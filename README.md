* Cases 1 & 2 are basically the same thing, but still included case 2 for reference (can't do much about these a part from the mentioned possible changes on the migration guide/the docs).
* Case 3 leads to [this error](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/485b776e48138ec9c571555f16f314b9e1392f3d/code/lib/core-server/src/utils/StoryIndexGenerator.ts#L198).
* Case 4 may be explained by [this test](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/12f4d50c89a35ad94d8cd785a712de58ac343cbb/code/lib/builder-vite/src/plugins/mdx-plugin.ts#L5).
* Still included case 5 as well, even though that works as expected.
